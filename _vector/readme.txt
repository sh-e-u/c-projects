This is a possible implementation of STL vector. Realized functions:
1. Default constructor;
2. Constructors with parameters;
3. Copy constructor and assigment;
4. Move constructor and assigment;
5. Simple iterators;
6. Common methods for vector container, like push_back(), pop_back(), at(), is_empty(), remove(), etc.
You can use and evaluete it. I'll be happy to recieve your feddback.
